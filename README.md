# Disc Golf Putting Practice Tracker

This is a simple Flask app that will allow you to track your disc golf
putting statistics while out practicing. 

You can record "rounds" of putting from a set distance by accumulating
"makes" and "misses" during the round. Once you end the round, you can
view the statistics for that individual round or all of your rounds 
from a specific distance.
